## Feature with explicit Topology 

%definition% 

A feature type using a topology property to reference an ordered list of references to other features. 

Other features may be either features with topology properties or GeoJSON (or FG-JSON) point objects.

This is a generalisation of the TopoJSON concept using inline data, but not limited to the LineStrings. Topological defined objects 
can be solids, swept volumes or any other concept.
