- title: Example GeoJSON feature using ArcWithCenter topology
  content: |-
    Arc with Center example.

    Topology defined by 2 end points and a centre that are references to features with point geometry.

    radius and arcLength are implicit but may be provided as optional properties of the feature.

      Arc example (3 points).

      Note that properties "radius" and "arcLength" are not required in the containing feature but defined for convenience.
