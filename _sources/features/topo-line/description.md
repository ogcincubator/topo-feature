## Topology defined Line

%definition% 

A feature type using a topology property to reference an ordered list of points.

The topology property has an ordered array, defining the direction of the line from the first to second and subsequent points.

This is a generalisation of the TopoJSON concept using inline data, and hence not limited to linestrings.
