  "description": "Defines Feature (object) topology using a _topology_ property to reference an ordered list of references to other features. \n\nOther features may be either features with topology properties or GeoJSON (or FG-JSON) point objects.\n\nTopo-Feature defined objects can be solids, swept volumes or any other concept. \n\nNote: This is a generalisation of the TopoJSON concept using inline data, (nested sets of coordinates) but not limited to self-contained geometries (i.e. it allows for general topology to be described between independent features (objects) with any geometry dimensions)\n\nTopo-Feature doesnt use TopoJSON's coordinate compaction and transformation, however it does allow for explicit CRS, and coordinate compaction transformations could be defined as derived CRS if required.)\n",
