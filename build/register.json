  "description": "Defines Feature (object) topology using a _topology_ property to reference an ordered list of references to other features. \n\nOther features may be either features with topology properties or GeoJSON (or FG-JSON) geometry properties.\n\nTopo-Feature defined objects can be solids, swept volumes or any other concept. \n\nTopo-Feature allows for general topology to be described between independent features (objects) with any geometry dimensions. \n\nTopo-Feature-Collections define a self-contained set of such objects with referential integrity (all elements are present to fully define geometry coordinates.\n\nNote: This is a generalisation of the TopoJSON concept using inline, nested arrays of coordinates - but not limited to self-contained geometries per feature, duplicated between topologically related features.. \n\n_Topo-Feature allows for explicit CRS. If desired coordinate compaction transformations could be defined as per TopoJSON functionality, using specialised CRS definition._\n",
